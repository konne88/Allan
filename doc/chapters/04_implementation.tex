    Purely lisp
    Several source files which are included automatically
    Naming
    The workflow is as follows:
        1. Read input data
        2. Convert to graph/list representation
        3. Scan for cycles via dfs
        4. If there are cycles with more than 3 nodes, abort/invalidate
        5. Check 3-node-cycles for local consistency
            - Normalize
            - Apply p-function between two edges
            - Intersect with resulting edge
            - Check for empty set
        6. Output result, whether recipe is consistent
        7. Read execution plan
        8. Infer time relations between execution steps
        9. Create fully connected graph
        10. Intersect execution step graph with recipe graph
        11. Check consistency of result
        12. Output result, whether execution plan matches the recipe
    steps.csv is ignored
    Usage of external library ``split-sequence.lsp''
    Project files and directories:
        .git: version control
        doc: sources for this documentation
        allan.lsp: Implementation of the basic allen-logic as created in class
        graph.lsp: Graph-processing functions for cycle-detection
        graph-tools.lsp: Consistency checking and file-i/o
        split-sequence.lsp: External library for processing the CSV
        verfication.lsp: The ``main''-file. Includes all others. Execution plan
        validation
    The files contain test cases which may produce some noise in the output.
